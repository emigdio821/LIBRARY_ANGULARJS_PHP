# LIBRARY_ANGULARJS_PHP
Web library using AngularJs, Materialize and PHP.

Steps to install this app:

>Clone the project or download as a ZIP file.

Since the app is using CDN to import AngularJs, Materialize and other components, we do not need to worry about this.
Otherwise, user is required to install XAMPP or similar to be able and run this app.

Inside XAMPP or similar, we can import the database (phpMyadmin for example) which is inside the DB folder, also we need to run Apache service to make PHP works.
That is it, you are all set, just open the project by using localhost/project_folder
